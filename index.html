    <p>I am native Michigander. I enjoy spending time with family and friends during my leisure time.
        I have taken interest in learning about coding camp as of last year in 2022. 
        Currently I work for Rocket Mortgage where they offered me a great opportunity to 
        join Grand Circus Bootcamp to learn the great world of coding.</p>
       
        <h2>How I got my start</h2>
        <p>Per my introduction I started taking interest in becoming a sofeware engineer and/or sofeware developer in 
            2022. I referred to YouTube to obtain different point of views of people that
            are within the industry of being a developer. I soon realize that I was taking more and more 
            interest in becoming a sofware developer myself. My next steps were to introduce myself
            to people within the company I work for which is Rocket Mortgage. A collegue of mine mentioned
            Grand Circus Bootcamp and spoke highly of the JavaScript Full Stack coding class.</p>
            <p> Fast forward to March; I personnely have a cousin that is a sofeware developer.
                He informed that his personnel experience was great taking a bootcamp course.
                In conclusion hearing the different experieces helped me to see that becoming a sofeware
                developer is something that I can personnely take on.</p>
